                    <h2>Q: What is the main difference between an Asset and a Liability?</h2>
                    <strong>A:</strong>
                    <p>An **Asset** is something you *own* that puts money in your pocket (like cash or a machine). A **Liability** is something you *owe* that takes money out of your pocket (like a loan or a bill).</p>

                    <h2>Q: Why do companies use Accrual Accounting?</h2>
                    <strong>A:</strong>
                    <p>Accrual accounting gives a better picture of a company's performance by matching **revenue** (money earned) with the **expenses** (costs) that helped earn it, even if the cash hasn't moved yet. It's more honest than just tracking cash.</p>

                    <h2>Q: What is P/E Ratio used for on the stock market?</h2>
                    <strong>A:</strong>
                    <p>The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio is like a price tag on a stock. It tells you how many dollars investors are willing to pay for every one dollar of a company's profit. A high P/E often means investors expect high future growth!</p>
