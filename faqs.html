                <h2>Data Source and Methodology</h2>
                <p>The data (the 329 terms, definitions, and examples) is manually curated and stored directly within the **<code>script.js</code>** file. This approach was chosen to make the project **simple to deploy** and maintain for beginners.</p>
                <p>Definitions are synthesized from established texts on GAAP, IFRS, and corporate finance, ensuring accuracy while maintaining accessibility.</p>
